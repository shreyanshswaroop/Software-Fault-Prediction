# Software_fault_prediction

One crucial step in the software development process is the accurate identification of software
defects. A crucial step in the software development process is defect identification. Reducing
software defects is very desired for a software development project. The primary objective of
creating program patterns is to locate software defects.
Finding defects in a vast and sophisticated software system is the major challenge of software
fault detection.
The main goal of software fault prediction is to use the underlying properties of the source code
of a software project to predict faults before the actual testing process begins. This will help in
prioritizing the work in the testing process.
